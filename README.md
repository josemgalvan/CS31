# CS31
Projects for Computer Science 31 in the Spring of 2021 with Professor David Smallberg at UCLA
These are my solutions to all UCLA CS31 HW/Projects from Spring of 2021. The README.md for each folder contains the project specifications. Please do not try to re-use any of my code for future classes. The purpose of this repository was to display my work.
